## Self Critique

+++

### What did we do well?

+++

### What did we learn?
* What a web application is comprised of in terms of front-end and back-end and how the two interact with each other
* What a RESTful API is and how to write one
* How to define database models, set up a Postgres database, and manipulate it using SQL and an ORM like SQLAlchemy
* How to use Javascript and React

+++

### What can we do better?
* Search
    * Our search time outs for queries with too many results because it does the whole query at once (i.e. query="drawing")
* Mobile Site
    * Hamburger menu doesn't work
    * On desktop when the window is resized, mobile settings are applied and the paging buttons move to the middle of the screen

+++

### (continued)
* Data
    * There weren't many good RESTful API sources for our topic
    * We have limited data on artists and not many well-known artists since our source APIs are limited to the works contained in a specific museum
    * Artists don't have data on all their works, only the works in the museums we scraped
    * Data on only five museums

+++

### What puzzles us?
* Search
    * How to search across multiple tables and have the combined results sorted by relevancy (Our method was kind of hacky)
*

## Critique of endangered-animals.me

+++

### What did they do well?

* Search
    * Very fast search results that appear on the model pages themselves

+++

### What did we learn from their website?

* They did everything in javascript??

+++

### What can they do better?

* Model Pages
    * Too much data is shown on the model page with multiple instances
    * We think it should be more condensed and expanded upon in the individual instance page
* Filtering and Search
    * It seems a little bit overkill to have a general search as well as search functions for every attribute of every model
    * It would be nice to be able to search multiple models at once rather than one at a time

### What puzzles us about their website?
